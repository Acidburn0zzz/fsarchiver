.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B savefs
Save
.I filesystems
to
.IR archive .
.TP
.B restfs
Restore filesystems from
.IR archive .
This overwrites the existing data on
.IR filesystems .
Zero-based index
.I n
indicates the part of the archive to restore.
Optionally, a filesystem may be converted to
.IR fstype .
.TP
.B savedir
Save
.I directories
to
.I archive
(similar to a compressed tarball).
.TP
.B restdir
Restore data from 
.I archive
which is not based on a filesystem to
.IR destination .
.TP
.B archinfo
Show information about an existing
.I archive
file and its contents.
.TP
.B probe
Show list of filesystems detected on the disks.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -o
Overwrite the archive if it already exists instead of failing.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode (can be used several times to increase the level of details).
The details will be printed to the console.
.TP
.B -d
Debug mode (can be used several times to increase the level of details).
The details will be printed to /var/log/fsarchiver.log.
.TP
.B -A
Allow to save a filesystem which is mounted in read-write (live backup).
By default fsarchiver fails with an error if the partition if mounted 
in read-write mode which allows modifications to be done on the filesystem
during the backup. Modifications can drive to inconsistencies in the backup.
Using lvm snapshots is the recommended way to make backups since it will
provide consistency, but it is only available for filesystems which are on
LVM logical-volumes.
.TP
.B -a
Allow to run savefs when partition is mounted without the acl/xattr options.
By default fsarchiver fails with an error if the partition is mounted
in such a way that the ACL and Extended-Attributes are not readable. These
attributes would not be saved and then such attributes could be lost. If you
know what you don't need ACL and Extended-Attributes to be preserved then
it's safe to run fsarchiver with that option.
.TP
.BI "-L " label
Set the label of the archive: it's just a comment about the contents. 
It can be used to remember a particular thing about the archive or the
state of the filesystem for instance.
.TP
.BI "-z " level
Valid compression levels are between 1 (very fast) and 9 (very good).
The memory requirement increases a lot with the best compression levels,
and it's multiplied by the number of compression threads (option -j).
Level 9 is considered as an extreme compression level and requires an
huge amount of memory to run.
For more details please read this page: http://www.fsarchiver.org/Compression
.TP
.BI "-s " mbsize
Split the archive into several files of
.I mbsize
megabytes each.
.TP
.BI "-j " count
Create more than one compression thread. Useful on multi-core CPUs. 
By default fsarchiver will only use one compression thread (-j 1) and
then only one logical processor will be used for compression.
You should use that option if you have a multi-core CPU or more than one
physical CPU on your computer. The typical way to use this option is to
specify the number of logical processors available so that all the
processing power is used to compress the archive very quickly. You may 
also want to use all the logical processors but one for that task so that
the system stays responsive for other applications.
.TP
.BI "-c " password
Encrypt/decrypt data in archive. Password length: 6 to 64 chars.
.TP
.B -h
Show help and information about how to use fsarchiver with examples.
.TP
.B -V
Show program version and exit.
.SH WARNING
.B fsarchiver
is still in development, don't use it for critical data yet.
